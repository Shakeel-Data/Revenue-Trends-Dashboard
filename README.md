## üéØ Project Goals
- Developed a comprehensive **Market Trends & Sales Insight dashboard** to uncover key business insights and support **strategic decision-making**.
- Utilized **Microsoft SQL Server for advanced data cleaning, exploration, and transformation** of raw sales data sourced from Kaggle.
- Executed complex SQL queries to calculate essential KPIs such as **total sales, profit margins, quantity sold, and year-over-year growth**.
- Exported refined datasets to CSV format and integrated them into **Tableau for interactive data visualization**.
- Designed and deployed an interactive Tableau dashboard with **dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities, enabling stakeholders to explore category performance, regional sales, and time-series trends**.
- Provided clear visual insights into **high-performing product segments, underperforming regions, and monthly sales fluctuations**.
- Demonstrated full-cycle data analytics skills‚Äîfrom raw data ingestion and SQL-based transformation to **business intelligence reporting and data storytelling**.


## üìà Key Features
- **End-to-End Pipeline** : Full-cycle project from raw data ingestion to dashboard deployment.
- **SQL Mastery** : Leveraged T-SQL for data wrangling, KPI calculations, and creating export-ready datasets.

## üîß Project Workflow
### 1. üì• Data Collection & Import
Sourced a publicly available sales dataset from Kaggle, reflecting typical retail transactions. The dataset was imported into Microsoft SQL Server, setting the foundation for structured querying and analysis.

### 2. üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Using SQL, the raw data was cleaned by handling missing values, correcting inconsistent entries, formatting dates, and optimizing column structures. This ensured that the data was reliable, consistent, and ready for analysis.

```sql
                                                       ---üü¢ Exploration Queries---
-- Basic Record Count

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Records FROM Sales;
```

```sql
-- Check for Null Values in Key Columns

SELECT 
     SUM(CASE WHEN [Sales] IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Sales,
     SUM(CASE WHEN [Order_Id] IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Order_ID
FROM Sales;
```

```sql
-- Total Sales

SELECT SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales FROM Sales;

```

-- Regional Sales Distribution

SELECT [Region], SUM(Sales) AS Region_Sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY [Region]
ORDER BY Region_Sales DESC;

```sql
-- Monthly Sales Trend

SELECT FORMAT([Order_Date], 'yyyy-MM') AS Month, SUM(Sales) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY FORMAT([Order_Date], 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month;

```

```sql
-- Top 10 Best-Selling Products

SELECT [Product_Name], SUM([Quantity]) AS Units_Sold
FROM Sales
GROUP BY [Product_Name]
ORDER BY Units_Sold DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

### 3. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in-depth data exploration using a series of SQL queries to uncover key patterns, trends, and outliers. Advanced queries were used to segment data by category, region, and time to better understand business performance from multiple perspectives.

```sql
                                               --- üî¥ Exploratory queries ---

-- Sales, Quantity, and Profit by Category

SELECT 
  [Category],
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
  SUM([Quantity]) AS Total_Quantity,
  SUM([Profit]) AS Total_Profit
FROM Sales
GROUP BY [Category]
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;

```
